Welcome to my homepage! I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Toronto, advised by Professor [Radu Craiu] (https://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/craiu/) and Professor [Monica Alexander](https://www.monicaalexander.com/). I received my M.S. in Statistics from the University of Chicago in 2024, where I was very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Dacheng Xiu](https://dachxiu.chicagobooth.edu/) and Professor [Per Mykland](https://galton.uchicago.edu/~mykland/). Prior to UChicago, I received my B.S. in Statistics and Financial Mathematics also from UofT.

I am broadly interested in Bayesian methodology, probabilistic modeling, and approximate inference. My current research project focuses on developing Bayesian modeling and computational methods for producing probabilistic population projections, a key topic in (statistical) demography. My master's thesis was on large-scale realized volatility prediction with machine learning.

As a first-year Ph.D. student, my research interests are evolving as I explore the diverse topics within statistics and data science. I look forward to further shaping my research direction as I engage more deeply with the current literature and refine my understanding through discussions with my advisors.
